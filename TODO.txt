This program is still under construction. Here is a list of stuff to implement:
1. Guard against buffer overflow: This prevents incorrect/malicious input
2. Automate input textfiles with Python: No need for manual creation of expenses text files
3. Create a web-based version of this implementation

(Yes, I realize this would be made easier with database query languages and the like; but I need practice with C pointers)
